To download the game:
- You will need to download Gdevelop and open the game on there
- Then you can hit preview to start and play through the game

Problem statement:
- The problem at hand is how can we make learning automata theory relatable and fun for students.

Proposed solution:
- The obvious and most intriguing solution is to build a game. The structure of the game will 
  resemble the layout of a DFA. First, the player will be prompted a string constructed of 0s 
  and 1s, basically âˆ‘ = {0,1}. However, here comes the twist, the string is not finished, and 
  the player will have to figure out the rest to complete the game. Now, the player will follow 
  a series of levels depending on their decision they make. As they make their way through the 
  DFA, the difficulty will increase, each state represents a level. The only way to end the game 
  is by reaching a final state where the string created by the player matches the one that the 
  game accepts. 

Game play and layout:
- You will start at the beginning and press space to start
- You will then be at state 0, the start state where you will recive some instructions for how to play
- You will press enter again and be placed into level 2 where you will defeat a zombie minion
  you will loose health if the minion touches you and you can gain back a health with the green
  potion up at the top and to kill the minion left click on it. Then after you defeat the zombie 
  you will go through the door called 01
- You are now in level 3 where you will defeat another minion and this time after the minion
  is defeated you can choose between 2 doors "0 or 1" 
- Now you are in level 4 where you will be in a bit of a harder level and defeat the minons there
  once those minions are defeated there will be one more choice of "0 or 1" that will take you
  to the boss level.
- The boss level will have one or more Boss monsters that you will have to defeat to win the game!
- At the end you will have gone through all 4 states depending on what you chose you can be at 
  0100, 0110, 0101, or 0111
